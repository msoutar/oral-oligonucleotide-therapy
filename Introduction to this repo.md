# oral-oligonucleotide-therapy
The goal of this file is the replication and expansion of statistical analyses from a study of oral oligonucleotide therapies for PCSK9 enzyme inhibition.
The study, from Science Translational Medicine, is in the PDF file: oral cholesterol inhibitor scitransmed.abe9117.pds.  The study title is "An oral antisense oligonucleotide for PCSK9 inhibition" in Volume 13 from 12 May 2021.  The authors include researchers from AstraZeneca and Ionis Pharmaceuticals, Inc.  The corresponding author is Peter Gennemark: peter.gennemark@astrazeneca.com
The study containes five Figures (sets of charts) and one Table.  The raw data for each Figure and the table are in the Excel files. 
My goal is to replicate the Figures and the Table in RStudio.  This work for the publication is in MATLAB and GraphPad Software.
For this replcation, my steps include:
a) Loading the data to RStudio
b) Reviewing the data and transforming it, as needed
c) Running simple EDA (Exploratory Data Analysis) to include:
